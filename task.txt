1. JSON iterate over all for loops:
var obj ={
    name: "dhurai",
    age: 25,
    gender:"male",
    attendance:["mon","tue","wed","thur","fri"]
}
 for(var i =0;i<obj.attendance.length;i++){
    console.log(obj.attendance[i]);
 }
 OUTPUT:
 mon
 tue
 wed
 thur
 fri
 FOR IN LOOP:
 var obj ={
    name: "dhurai",
    age: 25,
    gender:"male",
    attendance:["mon","tue","wed","thur","fri"]
}
for(var i in obj.attendance)
{
    console.log(i , obj.attendance[i]);
}
OUTPUT:
0 mon
1 tue
2 wed
3 thur
4 fr




2.create your own resume data in JSON format
var resume ={
    name: "dhurai",
    age: 25,
    gender:"male",
    qualification:["10th","12th","degeree"],
    location:"chennai",
    experience:"5years experience in sales department",

3. Difference between window,screen and document:
window:
 -window is the execution context and global object for that context's javascript.
 -each browser is own top-level window object.
 -location giving the current URL.
 -history with method back and forward giving the tab's mutable history.
 -navigator describing the browser software.

screen:
 -the window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display.
 -screen properties width and height are the full screen.
 -screen properties availwidth and availheight omit the toolbar.
 -screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimension.
 -element will return an object with top,left,bottom,and right properties.

Document:
 -each window object has a document object to be rendered.
 -these object get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object.
 -the main object of the potentially visible document object model/DOM
 -document can also be window.document, screen can be window.screen, and window can be window.
 -document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML.
